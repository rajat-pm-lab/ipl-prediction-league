# SDE Handoff — Indian Lappa League

**For:** Developer building the production app
**From:** Rajat Singh (PM)
**Date:** March 17, 2026

## What You're Building

A **real-time IPL prediction leaderboard** for 13 friends. The frontend prototype is already built (React + Vite, deployed on Vercel). Your job is to wire up the **backend data pipeline** so the dashboard shows real data instead of sample data.

**Two data sources need stitching:**
1. **Google Form responses** — weekly predictions from 13 players
2. **Live match results** — who won each IPL match

**One output:** Leaderboard that auto-updates points, rankings, and prizes.

---

## Repo & Prototype

- **Repo:** https://github.com/rajat-pm-lab/ipl-prediction-league
- **Prototype:** `02-prototype/ill-dashboard/` (React + Vite)
- **PRD:** `01-design/PRD.md` (full rules, scoring, prizes)
- **Data model:** `01-design/schema.prisma` (Prisma schema, PostgreSQL)
- **Sample data:** `02-prototype/ill-dashboard/src/data/sampleData.js` — replace this with real API calls

---

## Data Pipeline: Step by Step

### Pipeline 1: Google Form → Predictions DB

**How it works today:** Admin (Vikrant) sends a Google Form each week. 13 players fill it out before the first match of that week. Each row = one player's predictions for all matches that week.

**What you need to build:**

#### Option A: Google Sheets API (Recommended)
1. Google Form responses auto-populate a Google Sheet
2. Backend reads the sheet via Google Sheets API (service account)
3. Cron job or admin-triggered sync pulls new responses
4. Parse each row → create `Prediction` records in DB

```
Google Form → Google Sheet → Sheets API → Backend → Prediction table
```

**API endpoint:**
```
POST /api/admin/sync-predictions
  Query: ?weekNumber=3
  Auth: Admin only

  Steps:
  1. Fetch Google Sheet rows for the given week
  2. For each row:
     a. Match player name → Participant.id
     b. For each match column, create/update Prediction record
     c. Validate: if match already started at submittedAt, mark isValid=false
  3. Return: { synced: 13, errors: [] }
```

**Google Sheet expected format:**

| Timestamp | Name | Match 15: CSK vs MI | Match 16: RCB vs DC | Match 17: KKR vs SRH | ... |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-23 14:30 | Rajjo | CSK | DC | KKR | ... |
| 2026-03-23 15:12 | Aman | MI | RCB | SRH | ... |

- Column A = Google Form timestamp (use this as `submittedAt`)
- Column B = Player name (must match `Participant.name` exactly)
- Columns C onwards = one column per match, value = team abbreviation predicted to win

#### Option B: CSV Upload (Simpler fallback)
1. Admin downloads Google Sheet as CSV
2. Uploads CSV via admin panel
3. Backend parses and creates Prediction records

```
POST /api/admin/upload-predictions
  Body: multipart/form-data with CSV file
  Query: ?weekNumber=3
```

### Pipeline 2: Match Results → Scoring

**Two options for getting match results:**

#### Option A: Manual Admin Entry (MVP — build this first)
Admin enters result after each match via admin panel.

```
POST /api/admin/match-result
  Body: { matchId: 15, result: "HOME_WIN" }   // or "AWAY_WIN" or "NO_RESULT"
  Auth: Admin only

  Steps:
  1. Update Match.result and Match.winner
  2. Run scoring engine (see below)
  3. Recalculate leaderboards
  4. Return: { match: 15, pointsAwarded: { Rajjo: 10, Aman: 0, ... } }
```

#### Option B: Cricket API Auto-Fetch (P2 — nice to have)
Use a cricket API to auto-fetch results after matches end.

**Recommended APIs:**
- **CricAPI** (cricapi.com) — free tier, simple REST
- **Cricbuzz unofficial** — scraping, less reliable
- **ESPNcricinfo API** — unofficial but comprehensive

```
Cron job: every 15 min during match hours (14:00-01:00 IST)
  1. Fetch today's IPL match status from API
  2. If match completed and result not yet in DB:
     a. Update Match.result
     b. Run scoring engine
     c. Log auto-update in audit trail
```

---

## Scoring Engine (Critical — get this right)

This is the core logic. Must match the rulebook exactly.

```javascript
// Called after every match result is entered
async function scoreMatch(matchId) {
  const match = await db.match.findUnique({ where: { id: matchId } })
  const predictions = await db.prediction.findMany({ where: { matchId } })

  for (const pred of predictions) {
    let points = 0

    if (!pred.isValid) {
      // Late submission — match had already started
      points = 0
    } else if (match.result === 'NO_RESULT') {
      // Rain/abandoned — everyone gets 5
      points = 5
    } else if (pred.predictedWinner === match.winner) {
      // Correct prediction
      points = 10
    } else {
      // Incorrect
      points = 0
    }

    await db.prediction.update({
      where: { id: pred.id },
      data: { pointsAwarded: points }
    })
  }

  // Also award 0 to players who didn't submit (no Prediction row exists)
  // They simply have no record = 0 points

  // Recalculate weekly leaderboard
  await recalculateWeeklyLeaderboard(match.weekNumber)
}
```

### Leaderboard Calculation

```javascript
async function recalculateWeeklyLeaderboard(weekNumber) {
  const week = await db.week.findUnique({ where: { weekNumber } })
  const matches = await db.match.findMany({ where: { weekNumber } })
  const matchIds = matches.map(m => m.id)

  // For each participant
  for (const participant of allParticipants) {
    const preds = await db.prediction.findMany({
      where: { participantId: participant.id, matchId: { in: matchIds } }
    })

    const wins = preds.filter(p => p.pointsAwarded === 10).length
    const losses = preds.filter(p => p.pointsAwarded === 0 && p.isValid).length
    const draws = preds.filter(p => p.pointsAwarded === 5).length
    const totalPoints = preds.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.pointsAwarded, 0)

    await db.weeklyResult.upsert({
      where: { weekId_participantId: { weekId: week.id, participantId: participant.id } },
      update: { totalPoints, wins, losses, draws },
      create: { weekId: week.id, participantId: participant.id, totalPoints, wins, losses, draws, rank: 0 }
    })
  }

  // Rank by points (desc), then tiebreakers
  await applyRankings(week.id)
}
```

### Tiebreaker Logic (in order)

```javascript
function tiebreaker(a, b) {
  // 1. Total points (higher wins)
  if (a.totalPoints !== b.totalPoints) return b.totalPoints - a.totalPoints

  // 2. Most correct predictions (count of 10-pt results)
  if (a.wins !== b.wins) return b.wins - a.wins

  // 3. Most weekly wins (weeks where player ranked #1)
  if (a.weeklyWins !== b.weeklyWins) return b.weeklyWins - a.weeklyWins

  // 4. Highest points in Stage 3 (playoffs)
  if (a.stage3Points !== b.stage3Points) return b.stage3Points - a.stage3Points

  // 5. Admin decision (manual override)
  return 0
}
```

## Database Setup

Use the Prisma schema at `01-design/schema.prisma`. Recommended hosting: **Supabase** (free PostgreSQL + realtime).

```bash
# Setup
npm install prisma @prisma/client
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Seed the 13 players
npx prisma db seed
```

### Seed Data (13 players)

```javascript
const players = [
  { name: 'Aditya', role: 'GRIEVANCE' },
  { name: 'Aman', role: 'PARTICIPANT' },
  { name: 'Deepanshu', role: 'PARTICIPANT' },
  { name: 'Rajjo', role: 'PARTICIPANT' },
  { name: 'Shan', role: 'AUDIT' },
  { name: 'Shivek', role: 'PARTICIPANT' },
  { name: 'Shubham', role: 'AUDIT' },
  { name: 'Sudarshan', role: 'PARTICIPANT' },
  { name: 'Suyash', role: 'PARTICIPANT' },
  { name: 'Tushar', role: 'PARTICIPANT' },
  { name: 'Utkarsh', role: 'PARTICIPANT' },
  { name: 'Vikrant', role: 'ADMIN' },
  { name: 'Vipul', role: 'FINANCE' },
]
```

### Match Schedule Seed

74 matches total. Admin can bulk import from IPL schedule. Schema:

```javascript
{ matchNumber: 1, teamHome: 'KKR', teamAway: 'RCB', dateTime: '2026-03-22T19:30:00+05:30', weekNumber: 1, stage: 'STAGE_1' }
```

## Week + Stage Mapping

| Week | Dates (Sun-Sat) | Stage | Approx Matches |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mar 22 - Mar 28 | Stage 1 | ~9 |
| 2 | Mar 29 - Apr 4 | Stage 1 | ~9 |
| 3 | Apr 5 - Apr 11 | Stage 1 | ~9 |
| 4 | Apr 12 - Apr 18 | Stage 1 | ~8 |
| 5 | Apr 19 - Apr 25 | Stage 2 | ~9 |
| 6 | Apr 26 - May 2 | Stage 2 | ~9 |
| 7 | May 3 - May 9 | Stage 2 | ~9 |
| 8 | May 10 - May 16 | Stage 2 | ~8 |
| 9 | May 17 - May 25 | Stage 3 | 4 (playoffs) |

> Week runs **Sunday through Saturday**. A match belongs to whichever week its date falls in.

---

## Auth (Simple)

This is a private 13-person app. Keep auth simple:

- **Option A (Recommended):** Invite-link with magic link / OTP via email
- **Option B:** Simple password login (admin sets passwords for all 13)
- **Option C:** Google OAuth (everyone has Gmail)

Admin panel needs role-based access — only `ADMIN` role can access `/api/admin/*` endpoints.

---

## Deployment

| Layer | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Vercel (already deployed) |
| Backend | Vercel Serverless Functions or Railway |
| Database | Supabase (free PostgreSQL) |
| Google Sheets | Service account with Sheets API v4 |

---

## Build Priority — What To Do, In Order

### Phase 1: Database + Data Ingestion (Do this FIRST)

| # | Task | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Set up PostgreSQL on Supabase** | Create project, get connection string, add to `.env` |
| 2 | **Run Prisma migrations** | Use `01-design/schema.prisma`, run `npx prisma migrate dev` |
| 3 | **Seed 13 players** | Insert all 13 participants with correct roles (see seed data above) |
| 4 | **Seed IPL 2026 match schedule** | All 74 matches with teams, dates, week numbers, stages. Get schedule from BCCI/IPL website. |
| 5 | **Build Google Sheets sync** | Connect to the Google Form response sheet via Sheets API. Parse rows → `Prediction` records. One-click admin trigger. |

### Phase 2: Scoring Engine (Core Logic — no bugs allowed)

| # | Task | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | **Build `scoreMatch()` function** | On match result entry: 10pts correct, 0pts wrong, 5pts no-result (to everyone). See scoring engine code above. |
| 7 | **Build `recalculateWeeklyLeaderboard()`** | Aggregate per-player stats for a week. Apply tiebreaker chain. |
| 8 | **Build stage + overall aggregation** | Stage = sum weeks 1-4 / 5-8 / 9. Overall = sum all weeks. |
| 9 | **Test scoring with sample data** | Use the sample data from `sampleData.js` as test cases. Verify points match. |

### Phase 3: API Endpoints (Wire up the frontend)

| # | Task | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | **`GET /api/leaderboard/weekly?week=N`** | Return ranked list with all stats. Match response shape above. |
| 11 | **`GET /api/leaderboard/stage?stage=N`** | Aggregated stage standings. |
| 12 | **`GET /api/leaderboard/overall`** | Grand tournament standings. |
| 13 | **`GET /api/picks?week=N`** | All 13 players' picks per match for the Picks tab. Match response shape above. |
| 14 | **`GET /api/player/:id`** | Player profile with stats, weekly points, team predictions, prize earnings. |
| 15 | **`POST /api/admin/match-result`** | Admin enters match result → triggers scoring engine → recalculates leaderboards. |
| 16 | **`POST /api/admin/sync-predictions`** | Pull latest predictions from Google Sheet. |

### Phase 4: Connect Frontend to Backend

| # | Task | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 17 | **Replace `sampleData.js` with API calls** | The React prototype uses hardcoded data. Replace imports with `fetch()` calls to your API endpoints. |
| 18 | **Weekly tab** | Calls `/api/leaderboard/weekly?week=N` |
| 19 | **Stage tab** | Calls `/api/leaderboard/stage?stage=N` |
| 20 | **Overall tab** | Calls `/api/leaderboard/overall` |
| 21 | **Picks tab** | Calls `/api/picks?week=N` — renders accordion match cards with all players' picks |
| 22 | **Player Profile page** | Calls `/api/player/:id` |

### Phase 5: Admin Panel + Auth

| # | Task | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 23 | **Simple auth** | Google OAuth or password-based. Lock admin endpoints to `ADMIN` role. |
| 24 | **Admin panel UI** | Page 3: enter match results, trigger Google Sheet sync, view audit log. |
| 25 | **Score override** | Admin can override any prediction's points with a reason (logged). |

### Phase 6: Nice to Have (Post-Launch)

| # | Task | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 26 | **Cricket API auto-fetch** | Cron job to auto-pull match results (CricAPI or similar). Removes manual admin entry. |
| 27 | **Instagram Story share** | Canvas-to-image generation + Web Share API. 1080x1920 story format. |
| 28 | **Real-time updates** | Supabase realtime subscriptions to push leaderboard changes to connected clients. |

---

## Frontend Tabs → API Mapping

| Tab | API Endpoint | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| **Weekly** | `GET /api/leaderboard/weekly?week=N` | Rankings, points, W/L/D for one week |
| **Stage** | `GET /api/leaderboard/stage?stage=N` | Aggregated rankings across a stage's weeks |
| **Overall** | `GET /api/leaderboard/overall` | Grand tournament standings, top 5 prizes |
| **Picks** | `GET /api/picks?week=N` | Every player's prediction for every match in that week |
| **Player Profile** | `GET /api/player/:id` | Individual stats, charts, match history, prizes |

---

## Critical Data Flow (End-to-End)

```
1. Admin creates Google Form for Week N (e.g., "Week 3: Match 17-24")
2. 13 players fill in predictions before first match of the week
3. Admin clicks "Sync Predictions" → Backend reads Google Sheet → Predictions stored in DB
4. Match happens → Result entered (admin or cricket API) → Scoring engine runs
5. Points calculated → Weekly/Stage/Overall leaderboards recalculated
6. Frontend fetches updated data → Dashboard shows latest standings
7. Repeat for each match in the week
```

## Files to Hand Off

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `01-design/PRD.md` | Full product requirements + rules |
| `01-design/schema.prisma` | Database schema (Prisma) |
| `01-design/SDE-HANDOFF.md` | This document — start here |
| `02-prototype/ill-dashboard/` | Working React prototype (deployed on Vercel) |
| `02-prototype/ill-dashboard/src/data/sampleData.js` | Data shapes + structures to match in API responses |
| `02-prototype/ill-dashboard/src/components/PredictionsView.jsx` | Picks tab component — shows how predictions data is consumed |

---

## Key Rules (Don't Miss These)

1. **Submission deadline** = before the first match of that week starts. If a player submits after a match has started, predictions for that match (and any earlier matches) score 0.
2. **No Result = 5 points to everyone** (not just those who predicted).
3. **Missing prediction = 0 points** (no Prediction row in DB).
4. **Predictions are locked** once submitted. No edits.
5. **Prize amounts are fixed** — see PRD section 4 for the full table.
6. **Lappa badge** — last place each week gets "Lappa of the Week" label (fun/banter element, important to the group).
7. **Picks tab must show all 13 players' predictions** — this is the audit/transparency feature. Everyone can see what everyone picked after match is over.

---

## Testing Checklist (Before Going Live)

- [ ] Scoring: 10pts for correct, 0 for wrong, 5 for no-result — verified?
- [ ] Late submission: predictions after match start → 0pts — working?
- [ ] Tiebreakers: correct order (points → wins → weekly wins → playoff pts → admin)?
- [ ] Prize amounts: weekly (₹700/₹300), stage (₹2500/₹1500/₹1000), overall (₹9000/₹5000/₹3500/₹2500/₹1500)?
- [ ] All 4 tabs return correct data (Weekly, Stage, Overall, Picks)?
- [ ] Player profile shows correct aggregated stats?
- [ ] Google Sheet sync handles duplicate submissions (last one wins)?
- [ ] Week boundary: Sunday 00:00 IST to Saturday 23:59 IST?
- [ ] Stage mapping: weeks 1-4 = Stage 1, 5-8 = Stage 2, 9 = Stage 3?
